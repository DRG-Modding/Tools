## Overview
This is a collection of tools and resources for modding Deep Rock Galactic.

If you don't find something you want here, you can probably find a tool you need here instead: [UE Modding Tools](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UE-Modding-Tools)

## Installing UE4.27.2
- Go to the Unreal Engine tab inside the Epic Games Store -> go to library -> add a new version with the `+` and change it to the latest `4.27.2` which is DRG's current version.
- I suggest going to options inside the installer when you get the chance and remove all the optional stuff so it only takes a bit more than 10 GB instead of 30 GB of space
- If you don't want to install the Epic Games Store (EGS) you can also download it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/DownloadingSourceCode/index.html) (WARNING: it's way faster and easier with the EGS)
